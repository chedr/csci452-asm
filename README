Important files:

	header.mak	for use with 'gmakemake > Makefile'

	courses.*	sample course files
	students.*	sample student files
	input.*		sample standard input files

	stdout.*	sample standard output files
	stderr.*	sample standard error files

	RUN		script to run infosys against the input files

You can test your program with the RUN script found here, or with
commands like these.  For Bourne shell and Bash users:

	./infosys courses.1 students.1 < input.1 > out 2> err

For C-shell users (note the use of parentheses):

	(./infosys courses.1 students.1 < input.1 > out) >& err

Each of these save the standard output  in a file named 'out' and
the standard error output in a file named 'err'.  For each test, the
RUN script also does a simple comparison of your output against the
"correct" output:

	cmp out stdout.1
	cmp err stderr.1

If the two files are identical, 'cmp' prints no output; otherwise, it
will either tell you the location of the first byte that is different
between the two files.

If there is a difference between the two files you are comparing, you
can go on to use the 'diff' command to display the differences:

	diff out stdout.1

If the differences aren't immediately apparent, look for the following
things:  a mismatch in the number of whitespace characters within
the text; extra whitespace characters at the end of the line (e.g.,
a trailing space character); non-printing characters in your output
(very common when working with strings - use 'cat -v' on the output file
to see if there are any of these in your output).

Any differences between your output and the test output should be
corrected before submitting your program.

NOTE:  These sets of test files test only some of the program's
functionality!  Be sure to exhaustively test your solution.
