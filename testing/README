These test drivers illustrate how you can test the individual functions
for this project.  You can expand them with additional test cases, or
use them as the basis for writing test programs for the other functions
you must test.

The Makefile for these programs was built specifically for this purpose;
it was not generated by gmakemake.  If you want to add your own tests,
you'll need to (1) add write permission to Makefile and (2) add your own
entries to the Makefile (you can use the existing entries as templates).
Do not use 'gmakemake' to regenerate the Makefile - it won't give you
a Makefile that works.

To use these test programs, copy your cmp_*.s, find_*.s, and/or new_*.s
files into this directory, and run one of the following commands:

	make			builds all six test programs

	make run		builds and runs all six test programs

	make test_cmp_course	builds only the cmp_course test
	make test_cmp_student	builds only the cmp_student test
	make test_find_e_by_course	builds only the find_e_by_course test
	make test_find_student	builds only the find_student test
	make test_new_course	builds only the new_course test
	make test_new_enroll	builds only the new_enroll test

Each test program prints a line of output for each test which indicates
what is being tested and the results of the test.  For the test_cmp_*
test programs, the result indicates the relationship between the two
objects and the result returned by your cmp_*() function.  For the other
test programs, the result is either "OK" if the function seems to be
correct or a description of what's incorrect.

Caution:  these tests are fairly basic ones; there may be aspects of
the functionality of your code that aren't tested here - e.g., whether
or not the new_*() routines are returning pointers that were really
allocated dynamically.
